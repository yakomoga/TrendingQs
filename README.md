## Setup

### Dependencies

- Run `npm install` in project directory. This will install server-related dependencies such as `express`.
- `cd client` and run `npm install`. This will install client dependencies (React). Also you need to run `npm install twit` to install the Twitter library for the Twitter API calls. Also you need to run `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap` and `npm install styled-components` for some elements that I've used in the fromt end.

### Database Prep

- Access the MySQL interface in your terminal by running `mysql -u root -p`
- Create a new database called TrendingQs: `create database trending`
- Add a `.env` file to the main folder of this repository containing the MySQL authentication information for MySQL user. For example:

```bash
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_NAME=facebook
  DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
```

- Run `npm run migrate` in the main folder of this repository, in a new terminal window. This will create a table called 'students' in your database.

- Make sure you understand how the `questions` table is constructed. In your MySQL console, you can run `use trending;` and then `describe questions;` to see the structure of the questions table.

### Development

- Run `npm run bot` to get tweet questions
- Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000
- `cd client` and run `npm start` to start client server in development mode with hot reloading in port 3000.
